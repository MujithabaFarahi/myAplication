#### Description:
This Application is a small game where a player can play with the computer or another player. Player can set a target before starting the game and also set difficulty to hard when playing against the computer. After starting player can throw 5 dices at a time and the sum of the values of dices will be the score of players. After first throw player can take those values or try again for two more times. Also, can take the value of one dice and throw the others again. At the same time computer will also throw 5 dices in a random strategy and a improved strategy when the difficulty is hard. Whoever reaches the target first will win the set. In multiplayer mode two players can throw and try to win.

In the first roll the human can select which dices to re roll but the computer cannot select which dices to re roll according to random strategy. Re-rolling all dices with could lead to the computer player losing points in the current round, as the re-rolled dice may end up with lower values than the previous roll. This could result in the human player gaining an advantage. this is unfair for the computer because the human can select the specific dice and stop the re roll of that specific dice this is not possible to the computer because it cannot decide which dices to stop so a strategy was implemented specifically for the computer. Compared to the random strategy this strategy is more competitive and interesting for the human. As the computer player cannot see the current dice selections of the human player, the strategy ensures fair play as the computer player is not making decisions based on the human player's current dice selection. The computer player is not only trying to win the game but also trying to maximize its score. By re-rolling its dices on higher values, the computer player can potentially get higher scores in subsequent rounds. On the multiplayer mood both the players can select which dices to not re roll and keep the higher values. So the fair play between the two players is ensured.
